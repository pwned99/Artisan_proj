A jailbreak for 12.1.3 - 12.1.4 it is NOT completed yet and this is only the demo version
This is going to be an iOS 12.1.3/4 jailbreak but it is NOT completed yet
This version doesen't do anything so far so if you tap on jailbreak it won't jb or install cydia 
this version just made to demonstrate what an ios 12.1.3/4 jb will look like
Also Do NOT upate to iOS 12.1.3/4 if you're on 12.1.2 or lower The first reason: The full jb is not released yet
second reason: I don't even know if im going to suceed or not so do not get your hopes up
Also, ETA kids, don't ask for ETAs because I don't even know it myself
